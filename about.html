                    <p>It seems like just yesterday when Victoria and Chrystal first met in the copy room of a public charter high school in Houston, TX. Victoria was an Algebra I and Algebra II teacher, while Chrystal taught English II and AP English Literature.
                        The two quickly discovered that they not only are both graduates of The University of Texas at Austin (classes of 2015 and 2014, respectively), but they also shared a love and passion for serving diverse communities through education.
                        Since then, Victoria and Chrystal have dedicated themselves to providing schools and organizations as well as students and their families with the support and resources to necessary to expand their access to higher education.</p>

                        and financial expertise is of assistance to you not just as a one-time service, but as a building of community and a fostering of a culture of education.

                            In high school, I was known equally for being a 'nerd' and an athlete. I was that student that went to regionals for the 4x200m in track and competed in a UIL AP Computer Science competition in the same year. With my love for all things Math and Science
                            being apparent very early on, I’ve been tutoring students in these fields since 9th grade. Naturally, in being from Texas and being a lover of Math, I went to The University of Texas at Austin to study Petroleum Engineering.
                            While there, I was a mentor for an organization called Student Engineers Educating Kids (SEEK). SEEK was definitely my weekly refuge from my engineering course work, and I always thought it’d be neat if I could do something
                            like it for a full-time career. After working in oil and gas for about two years, I decided to revisit my potential passion for education. I left my engineering job and spent some time in the classroom teaching 9th - 11th graders
                            Algebra I/II in my hometown of Houston, TX. Shortly after beginning my teaching career, I learned that I had been accepted to the Ph.D. program in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Georgia Institute of
                            Technology. I decided to pursue the opportunity to gain the expertise and credibility needed to have a broader impact on education. Since being at Tech, I’ve had the opportunity to be involved with K-12 outreach, work as a
                            content expert for STEM curriculum training for teachers in Gwinnett County, and serve as the newly appointed Associate Regional Director of the Southeast region of the Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the Environment
                            (GLOBE) program."

                            In high school, I was a high achieving student with great grades and meaningful extracurricular activities. I was also a first-generation student whose parents had no idea how to navigate the college admissions process. This makes for a great story of
                            getting to and through college! After transferring twice and attending three different universities in the span of four years, I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2014. Knowing how much of an impact my teachers
                            had on me, I decided to become one by applying to Teach for America. I was accepted to the 2014 Houston Corps and spent three years teaching in a college preparatory charter school. While there, I taught English II, AP English
                            Literature, Health, Speech, and a College Readiness course. Helping my students start to see themselves as ‘college-bound’ was the highlight of my teaching career, and I knew that I wanted to continue doing similar work. A
                            few years later and a move to Atlanta, GA would give me the opportunity to do just that. While completing my graduate studies at Emory University, I spent two years working in a college advising and tutoring office as a team
                            member, and my love for being an education consultant was confirmed. Launching Dean + Golden Education has been a dream come true, and I’ve enjoyed getting to know all of our students and families."

                            As a high school senior, my heart was set on attending one university. I got accepted, attended Summer Orientation, packed my things, and drove nearly 400 miles – only to learn that I didn’t have enough financial aid to cover the first semester. This
                            humbling experience became my catalyst for wanting to know more about the college admissions and financial aid process. After earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration from Buffalo State and spending a year in
                            corporate America, I began my career in higher education after realizing my passion for being an advocate in college admissions. Along the way, I’ve led diversity recruitment initiatives for several universities including Emerson
                            College, Northeastern University, and Georgia Institute of Technology. I've also advised hundreds of students, earned a Master’s Degree in Higher Education from Northeastern University, and worked tirelessly for underrepresented
