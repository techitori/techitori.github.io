                    <p class="font-weight-light">Victoria and Chrystal first met in the copy room of a public charter high school in Houston, TX. Victoria was a math teacher, while Chrystal taught English and Literature. Both graduates of The University of Texas at Austin, the two quickly discovered that they shared more than just an alma mater. They also shared a passion for serving diverse communities through education. Since then, Victoria and Chrystal have dedicated themselves to providing schools, organizations, families, and students with the support and resources necessary to expand their access to higher education.

                      It is our vision that groups that have historically had inequitable access to education will feel just as prepared and positioned for post-high school success as other students.

                      In high school, I was known equally as a 'nerd' and an athlete. I was the student that went to regionals for the 4x200m in track and competed in a UIL AP Computer Science competition in the same year. My love for Math and Science was apparent very early on, so much so that I’ve tutored students in these subjects since ninth grade.

                  <p class="font-weight-light text-justify">
                    Naturally, being from Texas and having a love for Math, I went to The University of Texas at Austin and studied Petroleum Engineering. During undergrad, mentoring through Student Engineers Educating Kids (SEEK) stimulated my interest in education as a career opportunity. After working in oil and gas for two years, I decided to revisit my passion for education. I left my engineering career to spend time in the classroom. I taught ninth through eleventh grade Algebra I/II in my hometown of Houston, TX before beginning my Ph.D. program at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Simultaneously, I am pursuing my MBA at the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business.

                    Since matriculating at Georgia Tech, I’ve been involved with K-12 outreach, worked as a content expert for STEM curriculum training for teachers in Gwinnett County, and served as a newly appointed Associate Regional Director of the Southeast region of the Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program."

My teachers, counselors, and professors were integral to my success as a student.

I got accepted, attended Summer Orientation, packed my things, and drove nearly 400 miles – only to learn that I didn’t have enough financial aid to cover the first semester. This humbling experience became my catalyst for wanting to know more about the college admissions and financial aid process. After earning a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from Buffalo State and spending a year in corporate America, I began my career in higher education after realizing my passion for being an advocate in college admissions. Along the way, I’ve led diversity recruitment initiatives for several universities including Emerson College, Northeastern University, and the Georgia Institute of Technology.

          <p class="font-weight-light mb-0 text-justify">"I was a high achieving senior with great grades and meaningful extracurricular activities. I was also a first-generation student whose parents had no idea how to navigate the college admissions process. This makes for a great story of getting to and through college! After transferring twice and attending three different universities in the span of four years, I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2014. Knowing how much of an impact my teachers had on me, I decided to become one by applying to Teach for America. I spent three years teaching in Houston, TX before deciding to go back into the classroom as a student to earn a Master of Divinity degree at Emory University.  While completing my graduate coursework, I had the opportunity to continue teaching, and I also discovered that I have a skill set and the knowledge base necessary to help all types of students and families with navigating their next steps. I believe strongly in the potential that all my students have, and I'm always happy to help them figure out their path. As the Chief Operating Officer, I oversee the programming, strategic planning, and manage client relations for Dean and Golden Education."</p>
